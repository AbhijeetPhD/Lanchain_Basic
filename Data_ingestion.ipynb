       "'The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.'"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

       "'Supervised Raw Video Denoising with a Benchmark Dataset on Dynamic Scenes\\nHuanjing Yue\\nCong Cao\\nLei Liao\\nRonghe Chu\\nJingyu Yang∗\\nSchool of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China\\n{huanjing.yue, caocong 123, leolei, chu rh, yjy}@tju.edu.cn\\nhttps://github.com/cao-cong/RViDeNet\\nAbstract\\nIn recent years, the supervised learning strategy for real\\nnoisy image denoising has been emerging and has achieved\\npromising results. In contrast, realistic noise removal for\\nraw noisy videos is rarely studied due to the lack of noisy-\\nclean pairs for dynamic scenes. Clean video frames for dy-\\nnamic scenes cannot be captured with a long-exposure shut-\\nter or averaging multi-shots as was done for static images.\\nIn this paper, we solve this problem by creating motions\\nfor controllable objects, such as toys, and capturing each\\nstatic moment for multiple times to generate clean video\\nframes. In this way, we construct a dataset with 55 groups\\nof noisy-clean videos with ISO values ranging from 1600\\nto 25600. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst dynamic video\\ndataset with noisy-clean pairs. Correspondingly, we pro-\\npose a raw video denoising network (RViDeNet) by explor-\\ning the temporal, spatial, and channel correlations of video\\nframes. Since the raw video has Bayer patterns, we pack\\nit into four sub-sequences, i.e RGBG sequences, which are\\ndenoised by the proposed RViDeNet separately and ﬁnally\\nfused into a clean video. In addition, our network not only\\noutputs a raw denoising result, but also the sRGB result\\nby going through an image signal processing (ISP) module,\\nwhich enables users to generate the sRGB result with their\\nfavourite ISPs. Experimental results demonstrate that our\\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art video and raw image\\ndenoising algorithms on both indoor and outdoor videos.\\n1. Introduction\\nCapturing videos under low-light conditions with high\\nISO settings would inevitably introduce much noise [8],\\nwhich dramatically deteriorates the visual quality and af-\\nfects the followed analysis of these videos. Therefore, video\\ndenoising is essential in improving the quality of low-light\\nvideos.\\n∗This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science\\nFoundation of China under Grant 61672378, Grant 61771339, and Grant\\n61520106002. Corresponding author: Jingyu Yang.\\nHowever, due to the non-linear image signal processing\\n(ISP), such as demosaicing, white balancing and color cor-\\nrection, the noise in the sRGB domain is more complex\\nthan Gaussian noise [28]. Therefore, Gaussian noise re-\\nmoval methods cannot be directly used for realistic noise\\nremoval [39, 41, 40].\\nOn the other hand, convolutional\\nneural networks (CNNs) enable us to learn the complex\\nmapping between the noisy image and the clean image.\\nTherefore, many CNN based realistic noise removal meth-\\nods have emerged in recent years [4, 19, 45]. These meth-\\nods usually ﬁrst build noisy-clean image pairs, in which the\\nnoisy image is captured with short exposure under high ISO\\nmode and the clean image is the average of multiple noisy\\nimages of the same scene. Then, they design sophisticated\\nnetworks to learn the mapping between the noisy image and\\nclean image. Since this kind of image pairs are tedious to\\nprepare, some methods propose to utilize both synthesized\\nand real data to train the network [19, 9].\\nIn contrast, the noise statistics in the raw domain, i.e.\\nthe direct readings from the image sensor, are simpler than\\nthese in the sRGB domain. In addition, the raw data con-\\ntains the most original information since it was not affected\\nby the following ISP. Therefore, directly performing denois-\\ning on the raw data is appealing. Correspondingly, there are\\nmany datasets built for raw image denoising by capturing\\nthe short-exposure raw noisy images and the long-exposure\\nclean raw images [1, 29, 3, 7]. However, there is still no\\ndataset built for noisy and clean videos in the raw format\\nsince we cannot record the dynamic scenes without blur-\\nring using the long-exposure mode or averaging multiple\\nshots of the moment. Therefore, many methods are pro-\\nposed for raw image denoising, but raw video denoising is\\nlagging behind. Very recently, Chen et al. [8] proposed\\nto perform raw video denoising by capturing a dataset with\\nstatic noisy and clean image sequences, and directly map\\nthe raw input to the sRGB output by simultaneously learn-\\ning the noise removal and ISP. Nevertheless, utilizing static\\nsequences to train the video enhancement network does not\\ntake advantage of the temporal correlations between neigh-\\nboring frames and it relies on the well developed video de-\\narXiv:2003.14013v1  [eess.IV]  31 Mar 2020\\nnoising scheme VBM4D [24] to remove noise.\\nBased on the above observations, we propose to con-\\nduct video denoising in the raw domain and correspond-\\ningly construct a dataset with noisy-clean frames for dy-\\nnamic scenes. There are mainly three contributions in this\\nwork.\\nFirst, we construct a benchmark dataset for supervised\\nraw video denoising. In order to capture the moment for\\nmultiple times, we manually create movements for objects.\\nFor each moment, the noisy frame is captured under a high\\nISO mode, and the corresponding clean frame is obtained\\nvia averaging multiple noisy frames. In this way, we cap-\\nture 55 groups of dynamic noisy-clean videos with ISO val-\\nues ranging from 1600 to 25600. This dataset not only en-\\nables us to take advantage of the temporal correlations in\\ndenoising, but also enables the quantitative evaluation for\\nreal noisy videos.\\nSecond, we propose an efﬁcient raw video denoising net-\\nwork (RViDeNet) via exploring non-local spatial, channel,\\nand temporal correlations. Since the noisy input is char-\\nacterized by Bayer patterns, we split it into four separated\\nsequences, i.e. RGBG sequences, and they go through the\\npre-denoising, alignment, non-local attention, and temporal\\nfusion modules separately, and then reconstruct the noise-\\nfree version by spatial fusion.\\nThird, our network not only outputs the raw denoising\\nresult, but also the RGB result by going through an ISP\\nmodule. In this way, our method enables users to adap-\\ntively generate the sRGB results with the ISP they prefer.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outper-\\nforms state-of-the-art video denoising and raw image de-\\nnoising algorithms in both raw and sRGB domains on cap-\\ntured indoor and outdoor videos.\\n2. Related Work\\nIn this section, we give a brief review of related work on\\nvideo denoising, image and video processing with raw data,\\nand noisy image and video datasets.\\n2.1. Video Denoising\\nIn the literature, most video denoising methods are de-\\nsigned for Gaussian noise removal [24, 21, 6].\\nAmong\\nthem, VBM4D is the benchmark denoising method [24].\\nRecently, deep learning based video denoising methods are\\nemerging. Chen et al. [10] ﬁrst proposed to apply recurrent\\nneural network on video denoising in the sRGB domain.\\nHowever, the performance is under the benchmark denois-\\ning method VBM4D. Hereafter, Xue et al. [43] proposed a\\ntask-oriented ﬂow (ToF) to align frames via CNN and then\\nperformed the following denoising task. The recently pro-\\nposed ViDeNN [11] performs spatial denoising and tempo-\\nral denoising sequentially and achieves better results than\\nVBM4D. Tassano et al.\\nproposed DVDNet [33] and its\\nfast version, called FastDVDnet [34] without explicit mo-\\ntion estimation, to deal with Gaussian noise removal with\\nlow computing complexity.\\nHowever, these methods are usually designed for Gaus-\\nsian or synthesized noise removal, without considering the\\ncomplex real noise produced in low-light capturing condi-\\ntions. To our knowledge, only the work in [8] deals with\\nrealistic noise removal for videos. However, their training\\ndatabase contains only static sequences, which is inefﬁcient\\nin exploring temporal correlations of dynamic sequences.\\nIn this work, we construct a dynamic noisy video dataset,\\nand correspondingly propose a RViDeNet to fully take ad-\\nvantage of the spatial, channel, and temporal correlations.\\n2.2. Image and Video Processing with Raw Data\\nSince visual information goes through the complex ISP\\nto generate the ﬁnal sRGB image, images in the raw domain\\ncontain the most visual information and the noise is simpler\\nthan that in the sRGB domain. Therefore, many works are\\nproposed to process images processing in the raw domain.\\nWith several constructed raw image denoising datasets\\n[3, 1, 29, 7], raw image denoising methods have attracted\\nmuch attention [17, 7]. Besides these datasets, Brooks et\\nal. [5] proposed an effective method to unprocess sRGB\\nimages back to the raw images, and achieved promising\\ndenoising performance on the DND dataset.\\nThe win-\\nner of NTIRE 2019 Real Image Denoising Challenge pro-\\nposed a Bayer preserving augmentation method for raw im-\\nage denoising, and achieved state-of-the-art denoising re-\\nsults [23]. Besides denoising, the raw sensor data has also\\nbeen used in other image restoration tasks, such as image\\nsuper-resolution [42, 46], joint restoration and enhancement\\n[30, 32, 22]. These works also demonstrate that directly\\nprocessing the raw images can generate more appealing re-\\nsults than processing the sRGB images.\\nHowever, videos are rarely processed in the raw domain.\\nVery recently, Chen et al. [8] proposed to perform video\\ndenoising by mapping raw frames to the sRGB ones with\\nstatic frames as training data. Different from it, we propose\\nto train a RViDeNet by mapping the raw data to both raw\\nand sRGB outputs, which can generate ﬂexible results for\\ndifferent users.\\n2.3. Noisy Image and Video Datasets\\nSince the training data is essential for realistic noise re-\\nmoval, many works focus on noisy-clean image pairs con-\\nstruction. There are two strategies to generate clean im-\\nages. One approach is generating the noise-free image by\\naveraging multiple frames for one static scene and all the\\nimages are captured by a stationary camera with ﬁxed set-\\ntings [28, 45, 38, 1]. In this way, the clean image has sim-\\nilar brightness with the noisy ones. The noisy images in\\n[28, 45, 38] are saved in sRGB format. Another strategy is\\ncapturing a static scene under low/high ISO setting and use\\nthe low ISO image as the ground truth of the noisy high ISO\\nimage, such as the RENOIR dataset [3], the DND dataset\\n[29], and SID dataset [7]. The images in RENOIR, DND,\\nSIDD [1], and SID are all captured in raw format, and the\\nsRGB images are synthesized according to some image ISP\\nmodules. Recently, the work in [8] constructed a noisy-\\nclean datasets for static scenes, where a clean frame corre-\\nsponds to multiple noisy frames.\\nTo our knowledge, there is still no noisy-clean video\\ndatasets since it is impossible to capture the dynamic scenes\\nwith long-exposure or multiple shots without introducing\\nblurring artifacts. In this work, we solve this problem by\\nmanually create motions for objects. In this way, we can\\ncapture each motion for multiple times and produce the\\nclean frame by averaging these shots.\\n3. Raw Video Dataset\\n3.1. Captured Raw Video Dataset\\nSince there is no realistic noisy-clean video dataset, we\\ncollected a raw video denoising dataset to facilitate related\\nresearch. We utilized a surveillance camera with the sen-\\nsor IMX385, which is able to continuously capture 20 raw\\nframes per second. The resolution for the Bayer image is\\n1920 × 1080.\\nThe biggest challenge is how to simultaneously capture\\nnoisy videos and the corresponding clean ones for dynamic\\nscenes. Capturing clean dynamic videos using low ISO and\\nhigh exposure time will cause motion blur. To solve this\\nproblem, we propose to capture controllable objects, such\\nas toys, and manually make motions for them. For each\\nmotion, we continuously captured M noisy frames. The av-\\neraging of the M frames is the ground truth (GT) noise-free\\nframe. We do not utilize long exposure to capture the GT\\nnoise free frame since it will make the GT frame and noisy\\nframes have different brightness. Then, we moved the ob-\\nject and kept it still again to capture the next noisy-clean\\npaired frame.\\nFinally, we grouped all the single frames\\ntogether according to their temporal order to generate the\\nnoisy video and its corresponding clean video. We totally\\ncaptured 11 different indoor scenes under 5 different ISO\\nlevels ranging from 1600 to 25600. Different ISO settings\\nis used to capture different level noise. For each video, we\\ncaptured seven frames. Fig. 1 presents the second, third,\\nand forth frames of an captured video under ISO 25600. It\\ncan be observed that this video records the crawling motion\\nof the doll.\\nOur camera is ﬁxed to a tripod when capturing the con-\\ntinuous M frames and therefore the captured frames are\\nwell aligned. Since higher ISO will introduce more noise,\\nwe captured 500 frames for the averaging when ISO is\\n25600. We note that there is still slight noise after aver-\\naging noisy frames, and we further applied BM3D [12] to\\nthe averaged frame to get a totally clean ground truth. The\\ndetailed information for our captured noisy-clean dataset is\\nlisted in the supplementary material. These captured noisy-\\nclean videos not only enable supervised training but also\\nenable quantitative evaluation.\\nSince it is difﬁcult to control outdoor objects, the above\\nnoisy-clean video capturing approach is only applied to in-\\ndoor scenes. The captured 11 indoor scenes are split into\\ntraining and validation set (6 scenes), and testing set (5\\nscenes). We used the training set to ﬁnetune our model\\nwhich has been pretrained on synthetic raw video dataset\\n(detailed in the following section) and used the testing set\\nto test our model. We also captured another 50 outdoor dy-\\nnamic videos under different ISO levels to further test our\\ntrained model.\\nFigure 1. Sample frames of the captured noisy-clean video under\\nISO 25600. From left to right, they are respectively the 2nd, 3rd,\\nand 4th frames in the video. From top to down, each row lists the\\nraw noisy video, raw clean video, sRGB noisy video, and sRGB\\nclean video, respectively. The color videos are generated from raw\\nvideo using our pre-trained ISP module.\\n3.2. Synthesized Raw Video Dataset\\nSince it is difﬁcult to capture videos for various moving\\nobjects, we further propose to synthesize noisy videos as\\nsupplementary training data. We choose four videos from\\nMOTChallenge dataset [25], which contains scene motion,\\ncamera motion, or both. These videos are sRGB videos and\\neach video has several hundreds of frames. We ﬁrst utilize\\nthe image unprocessing method proposed in [5] to convert\\nthese sRGB videos to raw videos, which serve as the ground\\ntruth clean videos. Then, we add noise to create the corre-\\nsponding noisy raw videos.\\nAs demonstrated in [26, 15], the noise in raw domain\\ncontains the shot noise modeled by Poisson noise and read\\nnoise modeled by Gaussian noise. This process is formu-\\nFigure 2. The framework of proposed RViDeNet. The input noisy sequence is packed into four sub-sequences according to the Bayer\\npattern and then go through alignment, non-local attention and temporal fusion modules separately, and ﬁnally fuse into a clean frame by\\nspatial fusion. With the followed ISP module, a denoising result in the sRGB domain is also produced.\\nlated as\\nxp ∼σ2\\nsP(yp/σ2\\ns) + N(0, σ2\\nr)\\n(1)\\nwhere xp is the noisy observation, yp is the true intensity at\\npixel p. σr and σs are parameters for read and shot noise,\\nwhich vary across images as sensor gain (ISO) changes.\\nThe ﬁrst term represents the Poisson distribution with mean\\nyp and variance σ2\\nsyp. The second term represents Gaussian\\ndistribution with zero mean and variance σ2\\nr.\\nDifferent from [26], we calibrate the noise parameters\\nfor given cameras by capturing ﬂat-ﬁeld frames1 and bias\\nframes2. Flat-ﬁeld frames are the images captured when\\nsensor is uniformly illuminated.\\nRather than capturing\\nmany frames to estimate σs, which is the strategy used in\\n[14], capturing ﬂat-ﬁeld frames is faster. Tuning camera to\\na speciﬁc ISO, we only need take images of a white paper\\non a uniformly lit wall under different exposure times. Then\\nwe compute estimated signal intensity against the corrected\\nvariance to determine σs. Bias frames are the images cap-\\ntured under a totally dark environment. Since there is no\\nshot noise in bias frames, we use them to estimate σr3.\\n4. The Proposed Method\\nGiven a set of consecutive frames (three frames in this\\nwork), we aim to recover the middle frame by exploring the\\nspatial correlations inside the middle frame and the tempo-\\nral correlations across neighboring frames. Fig. 2 presents\\nthe framework of the proposed RViDeNet.\\nSince the captured raw frame is characterized by Bayer\\npatterns, i.e. the color ﬁlter array pattern, we propose to\\nsplit each raw frame into four sub-frames to make neighbor-\\ning pixels be the ﬁltered results of the same color ﬁlter (as\\n1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-ﬁeld correction\\n2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias frame\\n3The technical details can be found in the supplementary material.\\nshown in Fig. 2). Inspired by the work of video restoration\\nin [35], we utilize deformable convolutions [13] to align the\\ninput frames instead of using the explicit ﬂow information\\nas done in [43]. Then, we fuse the aligned features in tem-\\nporal domain. Finally, we utilize the spatial fusion module\\nto reconstruct the raw result. After the ISP module, we can\\nobtain the sRGB output. In the following, we give details\\nfor these modules.\\n4.1. PreDenoising and Packing\\nAs demonstrated in [8], the noise will heavily disturb\\nthe prediction of dense correspondences, which are the key\\nmodule of many burst image denoising methods [27, 18],\\nfor videos. However, we ﬁnd that using well-designed pre-\\ndenoising module can enable us to estimate the dense cor-\\nrespondences.\\nIn this work, we train a single-frame based denoising\\nnetwork, i.e. the U-Net [31], with synthesized raw noisy-\\nclean image pairs to serve as the pre-denoising module. We\\nuse 230 clean raw images from SID [7] dataset, and synthe-\\nsize noise using the method described in Sec. 3.2 to create\\nnoisy-clean pairs. Note that, pixels of different color chan-\\nnels in an raw image are mosaiced according to the Bayer\\npattern, i.e. the most similar pixels for each pixel are not its\\nnearest neighbors, but are its secondary nearest neighbors.\\nTherefore, we propose to pack the noisy frame In\\nt into four\\nchannels, i.e. RGBG channels, to make spatially neigh-\\nboring pixels have similar intensities. Then, these packed\\nsub-frames go through the U-Net and the inverse packing\\nprocess to generate the predenoising result, i.e. Id\\nt .\\nFor video denoising, our input is 2N+1 consecutive\\nframes, i.e. In\\n[t−N:t+N]. We extract the RGBG-sub-frames\\nfrom each full-resolution frame. Then we concatenate all\\nthe sub-frames of each channel to form a sub sequence.\\nIn this way, we obtain four noisy sequences and four de-\\nnoised sequences, and they are used in the alignment mod-\\nule. In the following, without speciﬁc clariﬁcations, we still\\nutilize In\\n[t−N:t+N] to represent the reassembled sequences\\nInR\\n[t−N:t+N], I\\nnG1\\n[t−N:t+N] InB\\n[t−N:t+N], and I\\nnG2\\n[t−N:t+N] for\\nsimplicity, since the following operations are the same for\\nthe four sequences.\\n4.2. Alignment\\nThe alignment module aims at aligning the features of\\nneighboring frames, i.e. the (t + i)-th frame, to that of the\\ncentral frame, i.e. the t-th frame, which is realized by the\\ndeformable convolution [13]. For a deformable convolution\\nkernel with k locations, we utilize wk and pk to represent\\nthe weight and pre-speciﬁed offset for the k-th location. The\\naligned features ˆF n\\nt+i at position p0 can be obtained by\\nˆF n\\nt+i(p0) =\\nK\\nX\\nk=1\\nwk · F n\\nt+i(p0 + pk + △pk) · △mk, (2)\\nwhere F n\\nt+i is the features extracted from the noisy image\\nIn\\nt+i. Since the noise will disturb the offsets estimation pro-\\ncess, we utilize the denoised version to estimate the off-\\nsets. Namely, the learnable offset △pk and the modulation\\nscalar △mk are predicted from the concatenated features\\n[F d\\nt+i, F d\\nt ] via a network constructed by several convolution\\nlayers, i.e\\n{△p}t+i = f([F d\\nt+i, F d\\nt ]),\\n(3)\\nwhere f is the mapping function, and F d\\nt is the features\\nextracted from the denoised image Id\\nt . For simplicity, we\\nignore the calculation process of △mk in ﬁgures and de-\\nscriptions.\\nSimilar to [35], we utilize pyramidal processing and cas-\\ncading reﬁnement to deal with large movements. In this\\npaper, we utilize three level pyramidal processing. For sim-\\nplicity, Fig. 3 presents the pyramidal processing with only\\ntwo levels. The features (F d\\nt+1, F d\\nt ) and (F n\\nt+1, F n\\nt ) are\\ndownsampled via strided convolution with a step size of 2\\nfor L times to form L-level pyramids of features. Then, the\\noffsets are calculated from the lth level, and the offsets are\\nupsampled to the next (l −1)th level. The offsets in the lth\\nlevel are calculated from both the upsampled offsets and the\\nlth features. This process is denoted by\\n{△p}l\\nt+i = f([(F d\\nt+i)l, (F d\\nt )l], ({△p}l+1\\nt+i)↑2).\\n(4)\\nCorrespondingly, the aligned features for the noisy input\\nand denoised input are obtained via\\n( ˆF n\\nt+i)l = g(DConv((F n\\nt+i)l, {△p}l\\nt+i), (( ˆF n\\nt+i)l+1)↑2),\\n( ˆF d\\nt+i)l = g(DConv((F d\\nt+i)l, {△p}l\\nt+i), (( ˆF d\\nt+i)l+1)↑2),\\n(5)\\nwhere DConv is the deformable convolution described in\\nEq. 2 and g is the mapping function realized by several con-\\nvolution layers. After L levels alignment, ( ˆF n\\nt+i)1 is further\\nFigure 3. The pre-denoiseing result guided noisy frame alignment\\nmodule. For simplicity, we only present the pyramidal processing\\nwith two levels. The feature extraction processes share weights.\\nreﬁned by utilizing the offset calculated between ( ˆF d\\nt+i)1\\nand (F d\\nt )1, and produce the ﬁnal alignment result ˆF na\\nt+i.\\nAfter the alignment for the two neighboring frames, we\\nobtain T ×C ×H ×W features, which contain the original\\ncentral frame features extracted from In\\nt , and the aligned\\nfeatures from In\\nt+1 and In\\nt−1.\\n4.3. Non-local Attention\\nThe DConv based alignment is actually the aggregation\\nof the non-local similar features. To further enhance the ag-\\ngregating process, we propose to utilize non-local attention\\nmodule [20, 16, 36], which is widely used in semantic seg-\\nmentation, to strengthen feature representations. Since 3D\\nnon local attention consumes huge costs, we utilize the sep-\\narated attention modules [16]. Speciﬁcally, we utilize spa-\\ntial attention, channel attention, and temporal attention to\\naggregate the long-range features. Then, the spatial, chan-\\nnel, and temporal enhanced features are fused together via\\nelement-wise summation. The original input is also added\\nvia residual connection. Note that, to reduce the computing\\nand memory cost, we utilize criss-cross attention [20] to re-\\nalize the spatial attention. This module is illustrated in Fig.\\n4.\\n4.4. Temporal Fusion\\nEven though we have aligned the neighboring frame\\nfeatures with the central frame, these aligned neighboring\\nframes still contribute differently to the denoising of the\\ncentral frame due to the occlusions and alignment errors.\\nTherefore, we adopt the element-wise temporal fusion strat-\\negy proposed in [35] to adaptively fuse these features. The\\ntemporal similarities between the features of neighboring\\nframes are calculated via dot product of features at the same\\nposition. Then the similarity is restricted to [0, 1] by the\\nsigmoid function. Hereafter, the features are weighted by\\nFigure 4. The non-local attention module. The green, blue, and\\norange modules represent the spatial, channel, and temporal atten-\\ntion respectively.\\nelement-wise multiplication with the similarities, producing\\nthe weighted features ˜F n\\nt+i, i.e.\\n˜F n\\nt+i = ˆF na\\nt+i ⊙S( ˆF na\\nt+i, ˆF na\\nt\\n),\\n(6)\\nwhere ⊙represents the element-wise multiplication, S rep-\\nresents the calculated similarity map, and ˆF na\\nt\\nis the aligned\\nfeatures of frame t after non-local attention.\\nAn extra convolution layers is utilized to aggregate these\\nconcatenated weighted features, which are further weighted\\nby spatial attentions by pyramidal processing [35]. After\\ntemporal fusion, the features are squeezed to 1×C×H×W\\nagain.\\n4.5. Spatial Fusion\\nAfter temporal fusion for the four sub-frame sequences,\\nwe utilize spatial fusion to fuse the four sequences to-\\ngether to generate a full-resolution output.\\nThe features\\nF R\\nfus, F G1\\nfus , F B\\nfus, and F G2\\nfus from the temporal fusion modules\\nare concatenated together and then go through the spatial\\nfusion network. The spatial fusion network is constructed\\nby 10 residual blocks, a CBAM [37] module to enhance the\\nfeature representations, and a convolution layer to predict\\nthe noise with size 4 × H × W. Except the last output\\nconvolution layer, all the other convolution layer has 4 × C\\noutput channels. Hereafter, the estimated noise in the four\\nchannels are reassembled into the full-resolution Bayer im-\\nage via the inverse packing process. Finally, by adding the\\nestimated noise with the original noisy input In\\nt , we obtain\\nthe raw denoising result Oraw\\nt\\nwith size 1 × 2H × 2W.\\n4.6. Image Signal Processing (ISP)\\nWe further pre-train the U-Net [31] as an ISP model to\\ntransfer Oraw\\nt\\nto the sRGB image ORGB\\nt\\n. We select 230 clean\\nraw and sRGB pairs from SID dataset [7] to train the ISP\\nmodel. By changing the training pairs, we can simulate ISP\\nof different cameras. In addition, ISP module can also be\\nreplaced by traditional ISP pipelines, such as DCRaw 4 and\\nAdobe Camera Raw 5. Generating both the raw and sRGB\\noutputs gives users more ﬂexibility to choose images they\\nprefer.\\n4.7. Loss Functions\\nOur loss function is composed by reconstruction loss and\\ntemporal consistent loss. The reconstruction loss constrains\\nthe restored image in both raw and sRGB domain to be sim-\\nilar with the ground truth. For temporal consistent loss, in-\\nspired by [8], we choose four different noisy images for It\\nand utilize the ﬁrst three frames to generate the denoising\\nresult ˆOraw1\\nt\\n, and then utilize the last three frames to gener-\\nate the denoising result ˆOraw2\\nt\\n. Since ˆOraw1\\nt\\nand ˆOraw2\\nt\\ncor-\\nrespond to the same clean frame Iraw\\nt\\n, we constrain them to\\nbe similar with each other and similar with Iraw\\nt\\n. Different\\nfrom [8], we directly perform the loss functions in pixel do-\\nmain other than the VGG feature domain. Our loss function\\nis formulated as\\nL =Lrec + λLtmp,\\nLrec =∥Iraw\\nt\\n−Oraw\\nt\\n∥1 + β∥IsRGB\\nt\\n−OsRGB\\nt\\n∥1,\\nLtmp =∥ˆOraw1\\nt\\n−ˆOraw2\\nt\\n∥1,\\n+ γ(∥Iraw\\nt\\n−ˆOraw1\\nt\\n∥1 + ∥Iraw\\nt\\n−ˆOraw2\\nt\\n∥1),\\n(7)\\nwhere Oraw\\nt\\n(OsRGB\\nt\\n) is the tth denoising frame in the\\nraw (sRGB) domain for the consecutive noisy input\\n[In\\nt−1, In\\nt , In\\nt+1]. λ, β, and γ are the weighting parameters.\\nAt the training stage, our network is ﬁrst trained with syn-\\nthetic noisy sequences. We disable the temporal consistent\\nloss by setting λ = 0 and β = 0 since minimizing Ltmp\\nis time consuming. Then, we ﬁne tune the network with\\nour captured dataset. At this stage, λ, β, and γ are set to\\n1, 0.5, 0.1 respectively. Note that, the temporal consistent\\nloss is only applied to the denoising result in the raw do-\\nmain since the temporal loss tends to smooth the image.\\nMeanwhile, the reconstruction loss is applied to both the\\nraw and sRGB denoising results. Although the parameters\\nof the pretrained ISP are ﬁxed before training the denoising\\nnetwork, this strategy is beneﬁcial for improving the recon-\\nstruction quality in the sRGB domain.\\n5. Experiments\\n5.1. Training Details\\nThe channel number C is set to 16 and the consecutive\\nframe number T is set to 3. The size of the convolution\\nﬁlter size is 3 × 3 and the upsampling process in pyrami-\\ndal processing is realized by bilinear upsampling.

Our ISP network is pretrained\\nwith learning rate 1e-4, and converges after 770 epochs.\\nThe two networks are ﬁxed during training the proposed\\nRViDeNN.\\nWe preprocess our synthetic and captured raw data by\\nblack level subtraction and white level normalization. Our\\nnetwork is trained with these processed raw data. During\\ntraining, the patch size is set to 256 × 256 (i.e. H = W =\\n128 in the sub-sequences) and the batch size is set to 1. We\\nﬁrst train our network using synthetic data with learning rate\\n1e-4. After 33 epochs, we ﬁnetune the network with our\\ncaptured videos and the learning rate is set to 1e-6 except\\nfor the spatial fusion module, which is set to 1e-5. After 100\\nepochs, the whole network converges. The proposed model\\nis implemented in PyTorch and trained with an NVIDIA\\n2080 TI GPU.\\n5.2. Ablation Study\\nIn this section, we perform ablation study to demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed raw domain processing,\\npacking strategy for raw input, pre-denoising result guided\\nalignment, and non-local attention modules in our network.\\nTable 2 lists the quantitative comparison results in our cap-\\ntured test set by removing these modules one by one. It\\ncan be observed that the PSNR values in the sRGB do-\\nmain is decreased by more than 1 dB compared with di-\\nrectly processing the noisy raw videos. By incorporating\\nthe packing strategy in raw denoising, i.e. processing the\\nRGBG sub-sequences separately and merging them in the\\nﬁnal stage, the denoising performance is nearly the same as\\nthat of the unpacking version. However, the parameters are\\ngreatly reduced since we only extract 16 channel features\\nfor each sub-sequence and the unpacking version extract 64\\nchannel features. By further introducing the pre-denoising\\nguided alignment module and non-local attention module,\\nthe PSNR values in the sRGB domain is improved by 0.26\\ndB.\\n5.3. Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed denois-\\ning strategy, we compare with state-of-the-art video denois-\\ning methods, i.e. VBM4D [24], TOFLow [43], ViDeNN\\n[11], and SMD [8], video restoration method EDVR [35],\\nand raw image denoising method DIDN [44], which is the\\nsecond winner of the NTIRE 2019 Challenge [2] on real im-\\nage denoising. We tune the noise level of VBM4D to gen-\\nerate the best denoising results. Since TOFLow and EDVR\\nare designed for sRGB videos, we retrain the two networks\\nusing our sRGB noisy-clean video pairs. Since ViDeNN\\nis a blind denoising method and there is no training code\\navailable, we directly utilize its released model. We give\\ntwo results for SMD. The ﬁrst result is generated with their\\npre-trained model and our raw image is preprocessed with\\ntheir settings. In order to compare with our method in the\\nfull-resolution result, we did not utilize the binning process\\nin SMD, and utilize the widely used demosaicing process\\n[5] to preprocess our dataset for SMD. The second result\\nis generated by retraining SMD (denoted as SMD*) with\\nour dataset6. During retraining, we remove VBM4D pre-\\nprocessing for a fair comparison. In the supplementary ma-\\nterial, we also give the retrained SMD results with VBM4D\\nas pre-processing. DIDN is retrained with our noisy-clean\\nimage pairs, and its sRGB results are generated with our\\npre-trained ISP module. We evaluate these methods on 25\\nindoor testing videos with GT and 50 outdoor testing videos\\nwithout GT.\\nTable 1 lists the average denoising results for 25 in-\\ndoor videos.\\nOnly DIDN and our method can produce\\nboth the raw and sRGB results. It can be observed that\\nour method greatly outperforms the denoising methods con-\\nducted on sRGB domains.

Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose a RViDeNet by training on\\nreal noisy-clean video frames. By decomposing the raw se-\\nquences into RGBG sub-sequences and then going through\\nthe alignment, non-local attention, temporal fusion, and\\nspatial fusion modules, our method fully takes advantage\\nof the spatial, channel, and temporal correlations in the raw\\nsequences. With both raw and sRGB outputs, our method\\ngives users more ﬂexibility in generating their favourite re-\\nsults. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of\\nthe proposed method in removing realistic noise and pro-\\nducing temporally-consistent videos.\\nWe build the ﬁrst\\nnoisy-clean dynamic video dataset, which will facilitate re-\\nsearch on this topic.\\nReferences\\n[1] Abdelrahman Abdelhamed, Stephen Lin, and Michael S\\nBrown.\\nA high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone\\ncameras.
